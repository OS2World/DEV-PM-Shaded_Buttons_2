<H3>10. ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS</H3>
If there's anything I learned in University, it's that I should always acknowlege
my sources (I once lost a load of marks 'cuz I didn't say Acknowledgements: none).
<UL>
<LI>The code for Shaded Buttons (at least when I started it) was largely based
on code found in <I>OS/2 Presentation Manager Programming</I> (Charles Petzold).
A lot of other code is also taken from there (part of Test1 and Test2 for example).
<LI>I used the documentation from <A HREF="http://www.prominare.com">Prominare's
site</A> to figure out how the normal buttons behave, and how to get PMCX to work.
<LI>I used some information from one of IBM's web sites, to figure out how normal
buttons behave, what certain messages mean, and what functions to use.
<LI>Thanks to Mark Benge and Matt Smith, for their GUI Corner column that used to
appear in OS/2 Magazine, before it shut down.  Their series on custom controls was
especially usefull.
<LI>Thanks to IBM for creating such a great operating system.
