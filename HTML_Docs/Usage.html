<H3>3. HOW TO USE IT</H3>
<P>Include ShadeBtn.H in your source file.  To register the class with the
Presentation Manager, call shBtnInit.  The class is called WC_shBUTTON.  To
make a button, call WinCreateWindow as you normally would to create a button
(except that you use WC_shBUTTON instead of WC_BUTTON as the window class).

<P>I've tried to make it so that all you would have to do is replace WC_BUTTON
with WC_shBUTTON.  There are only a few button styles that Shaded Buttons does
not support (see <A HREF="#styles">3.1</A> for more info).  I'm thinking
of creating another class that would be completely compatible with normal buttons.

<P>You can also make a button in a dialog box in a resource file.  See
the .rc files in the samples directory for an example.

<P>When the button is pushed, it will send a WM_COMMAND (or WM_CONTROL) message
to its owner, just like a normal push button does.  It can also be activated by
hitting the space bar when it has the focus.

<P>To change the colour of the button, send it a shBM_SETCOLOR with mp1 set to
the RGB value of the colour, and mp2 set to shBSC_BUTTONFACE to change the
button face colour, or shBSC_BACKGROUND to change the background colour.

<P>Another way to change the colour of the button is to use presentation
parameters.  You can also change the font this way.  (see <A HREF="#presparams">3.3</A>
for the presentation parameters supported)  To try it out, drag a colour from
the Mixed Color Palette onto a button in the demo program.  Or drag a font from
the Font Pallette.  (Try doing that in Windows!)

<P>To determine the version of Shaded Buttons, use shBtnQueryVersion().  It
returns the version number * 100 (eg. v 1.20 -> 1.20 * 100 = 120).

<P>When you link your program, link it with ShadeBtn.lib.  (hopefully it should
work with compilers other than emx.  If not, let me know, and I'll see what I
can do about it.)  Make sure ShadeBtn.dll is in a directory in your LIBPATH.

<P>Shaded Buttons is also a PMCX control, so it can be used in the Universal
Resource Editor, and Prominare Designer, as well as any other PMCX tools.  Just
register ShBtn.dll and it should work fine.  Make sure ShadeBtn.dll is in your
LIBPATH (or in the same path as ShBtn.dll), and make sure that you add
ShadeBtn.h to your header file before you try to compile.

<A NAME="styles"><H4>3.1 Button Styles</H4>
<P>These are the button styles supported by Shaded Buttons.  All the styles that
it has in common with normal buttons (except shBS_NOBORDER) are equivalent to
using just BS_xxxxxxx.
<TABLE BORDER=0 CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=5>
<TR VALIGN=TOP><TD>shBS_PUSHBUTTON</TD>
<TD>creates a pushbutton (default)</TD></TR>
<TR VALIGN=TOP><TD>shBS_CHECKBOX</TD>
<TD>creates a check box</TD></TR>
<TR VALIGN=TOP><TD>shBS_RADIOBUTTON</TD>
<TD>creates a radio button</TD></TR>
<TR VALIGN=TOP><TD>shBS_3STATE</TD>
<TD>creates a 3 state button</TD></TR>
<TR BGCOLOR=7F7F7F VALIGN=TOP><TD>shBS_AUTOxxxxx</TD>
<TD>makes the button automatically check/uncheck itself (AUTORADIOBUTTON is not
implemented yet)</TD></TR>
<TR VALIGN=TOP><TD>shBS_ICON</TD>
<TD>uses an icon instead of text.
Uses button "text" as the id number of the icon.  The text
should be in the form "#[iconid]<,[disablediconid]>" where
[iconid] is the id number of the icon, [disablediconid] is
the id number of the icon to be displayed when the button
is disabled.  The portion in between the triangular
brackets ( "<...>" ) is optional.  Normal text can be
placed at the end, and will be displayed along with the
icon.</TD></TR>
<TR BGCOLOR=7F7F7F VALIGN=TOP><TD>shBS_BITMAP</TD>
<TD>like shBS_ICON, but uses a bitmap instead.</TD></TR>
<TR VALIGN=TOP><TD>shBS_MINIICON</TD>
<TD>same as shBS_ICON, but uses the smaller icon size</TD></TR>
<TR VALIGN=TOP><TD>shBS_HELP</TD>

<TR VALIGN=TOP><TD>shBS_NOTOPLINE</TD>
<TD>removes the border on the top side of the button (when
VERTICAL is set)</TD></TR>
<TR VALIGN=TOP><TD>shBS_TOPROUND</TD>
<TD>makes the top side rounded (when VERTICAL is set)</TD></TR>
<TR VALIGN=TOP><TD>shBS_NOBOTTOMLINE</TD>
<TD>removes the border on the bottom side of the button (when
VERTICAL is set)</TD>
<TR VALIGN=TOP><TD>shBS_BOTTOMROUND</TD>
<TD>makes the bottom side rounded (when VERTICAL is set)</TD></TR>
<TR VALIGN=TOP><TD>shBS_NOPUSH</TD>
<TD>makes the button non-pushable (eg. to make status bars)</TD></TR>
<TR VALIGN=TOP><TD>shBS_NOBORDER</TD>
<TD>removes the border on the edges of the button. (left and
right borders if horizontal, top and bottom if vertical)</TD></TR>
</TABLE>

NOTE: the shaded styles are not yet implemented

<P>I've tried to make it as compatible with the normal button class.  Unless you
use BS_NOPOINTERFOCUS, BS_NOBORDER, BS_NOCURSORSELECT, or BS_AUTOSIZE, you
should be able to just replace WC_BUTTON with WC_shBUTTON in your source files.
(Note that shBS_AUTORADIO and shBS_USERBUTTON aren't implemented yet.)
